# IEEE 754 Floating Point Converter

This project demonstrates how to convert decimal numbers into their IEEE 754 floating point binary representations (both 32-bit single precision and 64-bit double precision).

## What I Did

- Implemented the IEEE 754 conversion logic using **Python**.  
  The Python script converts a decimal floating-point number into its binary form and outputs the corresponding IEEE 754 representation.

- Created a **web version** of the converter using **HTML**, **CSS (Tailwind CSS)**, and **JavaScript**.  
  The web page allows users to input decimal numbers and see their IEEE 754 binary representations interactively.

## Features

- Accurate binary conversion of integer and fractional parts.
- Display of sign bit, exponent, and mantissa for both single and double precision.
- Responsive UI for easy input and visualization.

## How to Use

### Python Script
Run the Python script to input a decimal number and get the IEEE 754 representation printed in the terminal.

```bash
python main.py
